# NOTE: requiring DINO flag to build libdino is not very nice. The flag is
# meant for apps to build with/without DINO support. The reason is that dino.h
# is used both by the app and internally by the lib. For the app purposes,
# dino.h is a no-op when DINO flag is not set. However, since then, the
# conditional dependency mechanism has been implemented differently (using a
# wrapper header in target/dino.h that does a conditional include and no-ops
# otherwise. So, perhaps we should remove the conditional logic based on DINO
# flag from dino.h.
